# Exploring PDE-data misspecification with statFEM, via SWE

This repository accompanies our work on studying statFEM model misspecification
with 1D shallow water equations (SWE). Misspecification, in this sense, follows
the statistical definition whereby the probability measure which generates
the data is *not* the same as the employed likelihood.
